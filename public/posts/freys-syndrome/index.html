            <p><strong>Frey syndrome</strong> (Baillarger’s syndrome, auriculotemporal syndrome, Dupuy syndrome, gustatory hyperhidrosis) occurs due to aberrant reinnervation following injury to the auriculotemporal nerve, most often following parotidectomy.</p>
<p>Because nerve regeneration takes time, presentation generally occurs 6 to 18 months after surgery.</p>
<p>While not lethal, it can significantly reduce patients&rsquo; quality of life.</p>
<p>The published incidence of Frey syndrome after parotidectomy varies from 4% to 96%. The wide range of rates reported in the literature reflects great heterogeneity of symptom severity, reporting, and diagnosis.</p>
<p>The auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the trigeminal nerve, consists of parasympathetics to the parotid gland and sympathetics to the sweat glands of the face and scalp. If injured, the aberrant regeneration of post-ganglionic parasympathetics (responsible for salivary secretion) along the pre-existing sympathetic pathways to the vessels and sweat glands of the skin leads to the development of Frey syndrome.</p>
<p>Facial warmth, flushing, and sweating in the territory of the auriculotemporal nerve overlying the parotid gland (preauricular skin, temporal skin, scalp, TMJ region).</p>
<p>Symptoms occur during meals, especially with spicy and sour foods.</p>
<p>Frey syndrome is less common in children and may occur during early infancy without a history of trauma or surgery. Symptoms usually occur around 5 months and can be misdiagnosed as food allergies since the Frey syndrome appears during the same period as food diversification. It can be distinguished from allergies: history of instrumented vaginal delivery, quick onset after a meal, occurrence with specific foods (sweet and sour) not related to common food allergens, rapid recovery without treatment, consistent and persistent location, absence of other atopic symptoms.</p>
<p>Approach is preventative, using fat flaps, musculoaponeurotic flaps, acellular dermal matrices, or other methods to provide a barrier between parotid innervation and sweat glands during parotid surgery. Botox has been used successfully in treatment but it requires regular re-administration due to diminishing effect.</p>

The wide range of rates reported in the literature reflects great heterogeneity of symptom severity, reporting, and diagnosis.","articleSection":"Posts","dateCreated":"2025-08-08T16:40:25Z","dateModified":"2025-08-08T16:40:25Z","headline":"Frey’s Syndrome","inLanguage":"en-us","name":"Frey’s Syndrome","timeRequired":"PT2M","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/freys-syndrome/","wordCount":354}</script>
